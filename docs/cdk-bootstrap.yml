#
# The CDK can be bootstrapped with this template by executing the following command:
#   
#   npx cdk bootstrap --toolkit-stack-name mcservers-cdk-toolkit --template docs/cdk-mcservers.yml
#
# You will need to modify the bucket name in the 'Outputs' section in order to work in your AWS environment.
#

Description: This stack includes resources needed to deploy AWS CDK apps into this environment

#
# Many of these CloudFormation template parameters will not be used for the following reasons:
#   1. The values are hardcoded in the template below (easier than passing them through the bootstrap command)
#   2. The underlying resources are not needed for this project
#
# DO NOT remove the unused parameters though since they are still required by the bootstrapping process.
