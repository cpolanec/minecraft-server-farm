# How to Contribute

This project is essentially a declaration of one implementation of a Minecraft server farm (running on AWS EC2 virtual machines). Collaborator access is strictly controlled in this project since changes to this repository would have the effect of updating that one implementation.

## How to report issues

Issues with the templates or scripts should be reported through the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/cpolanec/minecraft-server-farm/issues).

## How to suggest enhancements

New feature proposals should begin in the project's [Discussions board](https://github.com/cpolanec/minecraft-server-farm/discussions). Once accepted, the discussion will be converted into issue(s) and collaborators will be identified to contribute to the project.

## How to make changes

All changes should follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow to enable parallel contributions and to maintain integrity of the `main` branch.
